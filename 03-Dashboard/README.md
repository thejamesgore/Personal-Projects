# Dashboard

After recently finishing a contract to help a SaaS company migrate to a modern tech stack and and creating the main functionality of their client portal I thought a good personal project would expand on the knowledge I had gained and take concepts further by creating an admin dashboard.

This is something I had wanted to add to my final project on the General Assembly Software Immersive Bootcamp however it was beyond my ability at the time.
