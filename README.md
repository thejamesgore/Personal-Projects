# Personal Projects

These are the prersonal projects I've developed in my freetime to expore different technologies that have taken my interest with the objective of solidifying my existing knowledge and understanding of what I've learned so far, but to also stretch and further develop my current ability.

There are README.md files in each project folder


## Projects
--------

### 01-Meditation-Timer
A simple visual meditation timer made with html & css based on the original UI of Calm.com as this no longer exists on their site and I found it useful. 

### 02-iOS-StartUp-App-REACT-NATIVE
A luxury conceirge mobile app enabling the user to hire a chauffeur, rent a sports car, hire a private jet, book tickets/skip the queue at restaurants.

As I've not been taught react-native but learned react for my second ga-project I thought this would be a fun way to introduce me to mobile app dev, the different enrivments, and the differences/similarities between react & react-native.

Has been a great learning experience so far and I have lots more to add progressively overtime.


## bin
--------

Where projects go to die. I've likely built and trashed 5-10 side projects so far, that were created while working on larger ones, to isolate and understand functinality/concepts I've been learning to a greater degree. They can be considered as testing environments however some have potential to be interesting full blown projects themselves. 

All of those that make it to the bin do so as they're incomplete/for testing - and of those that do, some get trashed and lost forever.

The intent is to eventually flesh out the ones that survive as my skills develop over time.

### 01-Solidity

Experimenting implementing smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain

### 02-iOS-Yelp-API-REACT-NATIVE

iOS app testbox that that calls the Yelp API and produces results of restaurants on the front page using that data. Want to integrate this into a screen of another app. Also experimented with different ways to style the main page using react-naitive-vector-icons
