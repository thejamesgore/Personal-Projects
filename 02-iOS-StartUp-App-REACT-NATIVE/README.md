## How To Demo

There are some base requirements needed to demo this build. This was built for iOS so some styling does not work properly on android due to differences in the repspective opereating systems however the issues are purely cosmetic and if you wish to test the app using android or android emulator you can too.

1. Install the required packages using `yarn` in the app root folder
2. If not already installed, install expo using `yarn add expo`
3. Install xcode from the app store if you do not have an iPhone and wish to run the iOS build
4. In the app root folder type `expo start`
5. Download Expo Go from the iOS or Android App Store
6. To run on your phone scan the QR code displayed after running expo start
7. To run on your machine in terminal after typing `expo start` press `i` to launch the iOS app or alternatively use the GUI
