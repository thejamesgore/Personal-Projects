# Personal Projects

These are the prersonal projects I've developed in my freetime to expore different technologies that have taken my interest with the objective of solidifying my existing knowledge and understanding of what I've learned so far, but to also stretch and develop further.

There are README.md files in each project folder
## Projects
--------

### 01-Meditation-Timer
A simple visual meditation timer made with html & css based on the original UI of Calm.com as this no longer exists on their site and I found it useful. 

### 02-iOS-StartUp-App-REACT-NATIVE
A luxury conceirge mobile app enabling the user to hire a chauffeur, rent a sports car, private jet, book tickets event tickets, skip the queue at restaurants.

As I've not been taught react-native I thought this would be a fun way to introduce me to mobile app dev, the different enrivments, and the differences/similarities between react & react-native.

Still in development as funcitonality is built out but been a great learning experience so far getting a working mobile app running with base functionality.

### bin
Where projects go to die. I've liked built and trashed 5-10 side projects so far I created while working on larger ones to isolate and understand functinality better. All of those make it to the bin as they're incomplete and some of those get trashed and lost forever.

The intent is to eventually turn some of those fully functional and something I can be proud to share alongside the main projects in this folder
